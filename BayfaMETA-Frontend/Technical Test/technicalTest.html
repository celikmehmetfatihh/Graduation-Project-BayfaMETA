        <h2>Welcome to the Technical Test!</h2>
        <p>
          This test consists of multiple-choice questions that you need to
          answer within a specific time limit. You can only take the test once,
          so make sure you're ready before you begin.
        </p>
        <p>
          You will be presented with a series of questions, and each question
          has a time limit. Read the question and its options carefully before
          selecting your answer.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            To select an answer, click on the option you believe is correct.
            Once selected, the chosen option will be highlighted.
          </li>
          <li>
            Pay attention to the timer displayed on the screen. You have a few
            seconds to answer each question. If you fail to answer within the
            given time, the test will automatically move on to the next
            question.
          </li>
          <li>
            You can skip a question if you're unsure about the answer. To skip a
            question, simply do not select any option within the time limit, and
            the test will proceed to the next question.
          </li>
          <li>
            The test will continue until you have answered all the questions or
            until the time runs out. Once the test is finished, you will be
            directed to the home page automatically.
          </li>
          <li>
            Please note that you will not be able to go back to previous
            questions once you have moved on to the next one. Make sure to
            double-check your answers before proceeding to the next question.
          </li>
          <li>
            Stay focused and manage your time wisely. Try to answer as many
            questions as possible within the given time limit.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>

          button. Enjoy the challenge and have fun!
